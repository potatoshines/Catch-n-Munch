# Catch-n-Munch 🎮🍴

A fun and interactive computer vision game built with Python where you catch falling balls with your mouth before they hit the ground! This project uses **OpenCV** and **Mediapipe** for real-time face detection and tracking.

## Features 🌟
- **Real-Time Face Tracking**: Uses Mediapipe's Face Mesh to track your mouth and catch the falling balls.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Gradually increases the challenge with faster and more frequent balls as the game progresses.
- **Game Stats**: Tracks your score, lives, and best score across rounds.
- **Intuitive Gameplay**: Simple and accessible controls—just move your face to play!
- **Customizable**: Adjustable game parameters like ball speed, size, and maximum balls.

## Gameplay 🕹️
- **Objective**: Catch the falling balls with your mouth before they hit the ground!
- **Lives**: You have 3 lives. Lose one if a ball touches the ground.
- **Score**: Earn points by successfully "eating" the balls.
- **Game Over**: When you lose all your lives, the game ends. Your best score is recorded for the next round.

## Requirements 🖥️
- Python 3.8+
- A webcam (or any video input device)

## Notes: 📝
- The game needs improvement. There’s room for improvement in areas like UI design, more consistent ball speed, and other features.
- **Purpose 🎉:** The game is created for fun and enjoyment, as well as a learning opportunity for myself to work with computer vision, Python, and various other frameworks.
